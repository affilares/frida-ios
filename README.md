# Frida iOS

## Frida
Itâ€™s a dynamic code instrumentation toolkit. It lets you inject snippets of JavaScript or your own library into native apps on Windows, macOS, GNU/Linux, iOS, Android, and QNX. Frida also provides you with some simple tools built on top of the Frida API. These can be used as-is, tweaked to your needs, or serve as examples of how to use the API.

### Commands (via USB)
Show all the applications of the device
```
frida-ps -Uai
```

Starts the Frida Gadget
```
frida -U APP_NAME
```

Script injection
```
frida -U -l SCRIPT.js APP_NAME
```

Tracing native APIs (partial method name with wildcards allowed)
```
frida-trace -U APP_NAME -i "METHOD_NAME"$
```

Tracing Objective-C metods (partial method and class name with wildcards allowed)
```
$ frida-trace -U APP_NAME -m "-[CLASS_NAME METHOD_NAME]"
```

### Frida Gadget
Get instance object
```
var instance = ObjC.chooseSync(ObjC.classes.CLASS_NAME)[0];
```

Call method
```
instance.METHOD_NAME();
```

### Javascript
Call method (inside onEnter or onLeave)
```
var obj = new ObjC.Object(arg[0]);
obj.METHOD_NAME();
```

Print class and method
```
this._className = ObjC.Object(args[0]).toString();
this._methodName = ObjC.selectorAsString(args[1]);
console.log('Detected call to:');
console.log('   ' + this._className + ' --> ' + this._methodName);
```

Modify return value
```
returnValue.replace(ptr(NEW_VALUE));
```


## Scripts
### start_frida.py
Python script that given a script and a app bundle, it starts the app, inject de script and resume the execution.

### find_classes.js
Search for classes
* If no strings are specified in "search_class" array, the script will print all the classes.
* If one or more strings are specified in "search_class array", the script will only print classes which contains the strings in their name.


### find_methods.js
Search for methods
* If no strings are specified in "search_class" nor "search_method" arrays, the script will print the methods of all the classes (frida server might stop running if there are a lot of	classes).
* If one or more strings are specified in "search_class array", the script will print the methods of the classes which contains the strings in their name.
* If one or more strings are specified in "search_method" array, the script will print the classes which contains the strings in the name of one or more of their methods.
* If one or more strings are specified in "search_method" and "search_class" array, the script will print only the classes and methods that meet with the search criteria.

### hooking.js
Hooks into methods
* Given one or more classes in "search_class", it hooks into all their methods.
* Given one or more methods in "search_method", it hooks into all methods of any classes that meet with the search criteria.
* Given a class and a method, it hooks into the method of this class.
* Neither class nor method full name is needed in order to hook. If a partial string is given, the script will hook into all the methods that have the string in their name.

### replace.js
Replace methods return values
* Given an especific class, method and value it replaces the return value of the method.
* Method format: for example:  "- isJailbroken:"
* Data must be in the same array position (classNmes, methodNames, returnValues). For example: ['class1','class2']\['method1','method2']['retvalue1','retvalue2']
* If returnValues of a method is left empty, the method will be hooken but the script will not modify the return value.
